Author:

#### Background Context
- Web static
- I have a command interpreter for managing my AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, I will builde the front end step by step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

- Create simple HTML static pages
- Style guide
- Fake contents
- No Javascript
- No data loaded from anything
During this project, I will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of my page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of my page, the design. I will fix my HTML part before starting the styling. Indeed, without any structure, I can’t apply any design.

Before I started this project, I forked the AirBnB_clone for console I and my partner worked.
